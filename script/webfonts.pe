# DESCRIPTION
#   webfonts.pe saves a source file, cleans glyph outlines, coverts to tt outlines,
#   and hints fonts before saving hinted and unhinted variants in both .sfd and .ttf.
#   You may need to change the path variable in this script for your project;
#   by default it is set to ../Release.
#
# BUGS
#   Some functions are used twice in a row. This is because they
#   (for some reason) did not work properly when used once.
#
#   On my system, the generated *-TTF-hints.ttf has no hints? I don't know why.
#   *-TTF-hints.sfd does, however, have hints. A workaround was found by
#   Alexei Vanyashin <alexei.vanyashin@gmail.com>: split the script into two
#   parts - one with hints, one without.
#
#   I have not found a way to set "Really use Typo Metrics", and reportedly,
#   fontforge doesn't export it to the TTF files anyway.
#
#   It would be nice if fontforge could create a sub-folder for each version.
#
# TODO
#   Options to enable or disable hinted/not hinted versions.
